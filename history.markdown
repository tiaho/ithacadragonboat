The Ithaca Dragon Boat Club (IDBC) was founded in 2004. It was born out of a vision by
Amy and Sivilay Somchanhmavong, members of the Ithaca Asian American Association
(IAAA). What began as a dream to bring the ancient Chinese sport of dragon boat racing to
the heart of the Finger Lakes region soon turned into a thriving community institution.

The club's journey started with an incredible gift: two beautifully crafted dragon boats
donated by Dalian, China. These boats symbolized more than just equipment; they
embodied a cultural connection and a commitment to fostering understanding between
communities across the globe. From that moment, IDBC became a vibrant platform for
celebrating diversity, teamwork, and the rich traditions of dragon boating.

Over the years, the club has grown to welcome paddlers of all ages and backgrounds,
embodying a spirit of inclusivity and camaraderie. Whether gliding across the serene waters
of Cayuga Lake during practice or paddling in the heat of friendly competition, IDBC has
become a hub for cultural expression and physical endurance.

Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2024, IDBC reflects on two decades of forging
connections, promoting health and wellness, and honoring the cultural roots of dragon
boating. From its inception to its flourishing present, the club continues to unite the Ithaca
community, one paddle stroke at a time.
